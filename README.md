# pokedex

This website queries the Pokemon API to fetch an image of a pokemon and the type of the pokemon.

Features to Implement:

1. Action for invalid pokemon name entries. Currently, the website does not have any functionality for invalid entries.
2. Improve the suggest feature when user enters a partial name in the text box. Perhaps fetch an array of Pokemon names from the API
